ros-humble-moveit-task-constructor-msgs (0.1.0-1bullseye) bullseye; urgency=high

  * Fix cmake indentation
  * Alphabetize package.xml's and CMakeLists
  * ROS 2 Migration (#170 <https://github.com/JafarAbdi/moveit_task_constructor/issues/170>)
  * Port msgs to ROS2
  * Merge branch 'master' into wip-python-api
  * Modernize: require cmake version 3.1.3
  * Merge branch 'master' into wip-python-api
  * Merge PR #214 <https://github.com/JafarAbdi/moveit_task_constructor/issues/214> (fix various issues) and #215 <https://github.com/JafarAbdi/moveit_task_constructor/issues/215> (rework rviz introspection)
  * Rename process_id -> task_id
  * Rename TaskPrivate::id -> TaskPrivate::ns
    TaskPrivate's id_ actually served as a namespace parameter.
  * Merge branch master into wip-python-api
  * document axiom in StageStatistics.solved
    If the axiom is violated, sorting in the rviz panel will fail.
  * bump cmake version
    get rid of CMP0048 warning.
  * Merge #120 <https://github.com/JafarAbdi/moveit_task_constructor/issues/120>: Add computation timing
  * transmit and display computation in rviz
  * Merge branch master into wip-python-api
  * Introduce clang-format (#102 <https://github.com/JafarAbdi/moveit_task_constructor/issues/102>)
    * fix catkin_lint issues
    * introduce clang-format config and apply it
  * rework solution msgs
    - to allow solution wrappers (WrappedSolution, SolutionSequence)
    to transmit their comment and markers as well
    - introduced new SolutionInfo.msg,
    which is the info common to solution wrappers and actual SubTrajectories
  * Merge PR #72 <https://github.com/JafarAbdi/moveit_task_constructor/issues/72>: rviz property visualization
  * PropertyTypeRegistry to store serialization/deserialization functions
  * Merge branch 'master' into boost-python
  * Merge pull request #54 <https://github.com/JafarAbdi/moveit_task_constructor/issues/54> from ros-planning/pr-capability
    ExecuteTaskSolution capability
  * modified ExecuteTaskSolution.action
  * a move_group capability to execute Task Solutions
    This does not work perfectly yet in practice,
    but this is (probably) due to problems in upstream MoveIt.
  * SolutionBase: rename 'name' to 'comment'
  * Merge branches 'fix-remote-task-model', 'wip-cost-ordering' and 'wip-properties'
  * serialize stage properties
  * count all failures for statistics
  * introducing process_id
    The task id was not unique enough to distinguish different tasks.
    When a task publisher is killed and restarted, it usually comes up with
    the same task id. However, visualization doesn't notice this change and
    get confused / crashes when receiving task statistics and solutions.
  * reduce catkin_lint complains in core
  * DisplaySolution: struct to unify all data corresponding to a sub trajectory
  * cmake compatbility to 2.8.12
  * add myself as maintainer & travis recipient
  * removed statistics from task description
    - make TaskStatistics a latched topic too
    - subscribing to topics in order (1. description, 2. statistics, 3. solution)
    should ensure that we receive those latched messages in this order
  * receive task solutions
    - remove parent_id from StageStatistics message
  * split repo into different ROS packages: msgs, core, visualization
